The goal of this exercise is to document what you are doing when things
do not go according to plan.

We have a specific use case in mind: we want to build a book from a
github repository.

What happens in practice usually, is that we run into some problems. So
your real task turns into that of a bug-hunter and fixer. Luckily, you
have a community (the class discussion board) who might be able to help
you.

### What we want: build a book

Build the html version of the newest edition for Hadley Wickham’s book
`Advanced R Programming` from a github repository.

Steps:

1.  Clone the repository <https://github.com/hadley/adv-r>.
2.  Open the R project in the repository in RStudio.
3.  Activate the `Build` tab (by default in the top right panel). Click
    on the `Build Book` button.
4.  The book will be available in html format as index.html

**Deliverable (1):** what is the last word in chapter 15? - You don’t
have to answer this question, if things don’t work.

### What to do when things don’t work?

Errors happen, they are frustrating, but if we learn something from
them, we can turn them into valuable experiences.

- check the Questions and Answers forum in Canvas whether there is a
  solution available for your problem.

- if the above document does (not yet) include your question, document
  the error you encounter (be as concise and specific as you can at the
  same time)

- if the Question and Answers forum does (not yet) include a solution,
  describe one approach on how you tried to solve the problem (and how
  this did not work).

- submit the description of your problem in Canvas at Discussions \>
  Questions and Answers. Write the paragraph in the mindset that you
  want to get help from somebody, and you try to describe the problem
  you are encountering.

- Extra points (1 pt for the first suggested working solution): post a
  solution to one of the problems in the Questions and Answers forum
  (your own does not count!).

**Deliverable (2):** Write a paragraph on the biggest problem you
encountered when you were building the book, (and how you managed to
solve it.)

You can write your experience directly into the `README.Rmd` file.
Commit and push to your repo and you are done!
